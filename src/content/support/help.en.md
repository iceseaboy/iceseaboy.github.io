# Help & Support

Welcome to LastSeenWise! This page answers the most common questions about how the app works and how to stay in control of your privacy.

---

## What does LastSeenWise do?

LastSeenWise helps you monitor and analyze online activity patterns of your own WhatsApp contacts (e.g., when they were last seen online, how frequently they go online, etc.). It provides insights into status changes in a local and private way.

---

## Is my data safe?

Yes. Your data is **100% local**.

- We do not upload any of your contacts or activity to servers.
- No login, signup, or cloud sync is required.
- Everything stays inside your phone.

---

## How does it work?

The app detects status changes by reading on-screen indicators (e.g., "online" label) on your WhatsApp screen. It does this locally using Android accessibility service, with your explicit permission.

---

## Will WhatsApp ban me for using this?

No. We do not modify WhatsApp, intercept its data, or perform automation that violates their policies. Our app only observes your own screen, and does not impersonate or access WhatsApp servers.

---

## Tips for better tracking

- Make sure WhatsApp notifications are enabled.
- Keep the app running in the background.
- Allow required permissions (Accessibility & Notification Access).
